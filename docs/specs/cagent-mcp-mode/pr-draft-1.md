# ðŸš€ MCP Server Mode for cagent - Early Review Request

## Overview

This PR introduces a complete **Model Context Protocol (MCP) server mode** for cagent, enabling programmatic integration with external AI tools like Claude Code, VS Code extensions, and other MCP-compatible clients.

### Motivation

I've been working to integrate cagent into my broader AI workflow, gradually migrating from other agent tools to cagent. The challenge was that cagent's existing interfaces (CLI, TUI, Web) weren't easily programmable from external tools.

**The core problem**: If you're already using tools like **Warp, Claude Code, Cursor, or VS Code extensions**, there's no native way to integrate cagent agents into those workflows. You'd have to abandon your existing development environment to use cagent.

**MCP solves this integration gap** by providing:

- **Keep your existing tools**: Continue using Warp, Claude Code, Cursor while adding cagent agents
- **Gradual migration path**: Slowly shift workflows to cagent without disrupting current productivity
- **Programmatic access**: External tools can invoke cagent agents programmatically
- **Standardized integration**: One integration works across all MCP-compatible tools

## Request for Early Feedback

I've completed a substantial MCP implementation (details below) and have a clear plan for **Phase 5: refactoring the existing HTTP API to use the same underlying service core**. This would give both transports identical security, session management, and business logic.

**However, before I invest the time in the HTTP API refactor, I'd love your early feedback on:**

1. **Architecture approach**: Does the service core design make sense for this codebase?
2. **MCP integration value**: Do you see value in MCP as an integration strategy for cagent?
3. **HTTP refactor priority**: Should I prioritize the HTTP API refactor or focus elsewhere?
4. **Implementation quality**: Any concerns with code organization, testing, or patterns?

The MCP implementation is **fully functional and ready for testing** (see demo section below). The service core foundation is designed specifically to enable the HTTP refactor, but I want to ensure this direction aligns with your vision before proceeding.

## What's Implemented

This implementation includes **complete MCP server functionality** with the following phases completed:

### âœ… Phase 1: Service Core Foundation (Complete)
- **Multi-tenant architecture** with client isolation and session scoping
- **Agent resolution system** supporting files, relative paths, and Docker registry images
- **Security-first design** with path traversal prevention and client boundary enforcement
- **Comprehensive test suite** with 37+ test cases and isolated test environments
- **Database migration** for backwards compatibility (existing sessions preserved)

### âœ… Phase 2: MCP Server Implementation (Complete)
- **Full MCP protocol compliance** using `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go v0.34.0`
- **HTTP SSE transport** for real-time streaming responses
- **Command interface**: `cagent mcp server` with configurable ports, paths, and timeouts
- **Core MCP tools**: `invoke_agent`, `list_agents`, `pull_agent`
- **Enhanced tool descriptions** with comprehensive cross-referencing for AI agent clarity

### âœ… Phase 3: Session Management (Complete)
- **Persistent agent sessions** with full lifecycle management
- **Session-based tools**: `create_agent_session`, `send_message`, `list_agent_sessions`, `close_agent_session`, `get_agent_session_info`
- **Advanced session tools**: `get_agent_session_history` with pagination, `get_agent_session_info_enhanced` with comprehensive metadata
- **Client isolation**: All operations properly scoped to prevent cross-client access

### âœ… Phase 4: Production Features (Partial - Advanced Tools Complete)
- **Advanced MCP tools** with conversation history and enhanced session metadata
- **Self-documenting API** with comprehensive tool descriptions that reference each other
- **Research completed** on dynamic agent configuration feasibility

## Architecture Highlights

### Service Core Design
The implementation introduces a **clean service core layer** (`pkg/servicecore/`) that:
- **Abstracts business logic** from transport concerns (MCP vs HTTP)
- **Enforces security boundaries** with client-scoped operations
- **Provides testable interfaces** with dependency injection
- **Enables future HTTP API refactor** (Phase 5 - planned)

### Security Model
- **Client isolation**: Each MCP client gets a unique ID with isolated sessions
- **Path security**: Agent file access restricted to configured root directories  
- **Resource limits**: Configurable session limits per client with automatic cleanup
- **Zero cross-client access**: Complete prevention of session hijacking

### Multi-Tenant Session Storage
- **Non-breaking database migration**: Added `client_id` column with `'__global'` default
- **Backwards compatibility**: Existing HTTP sessions continue working unchanged
- **Future-ready**: Prepared for HTTP API client authentication

## Current Capabilities

The MCP server provides a **complete agent interaction API**:

```bash
# Start MCP server
./bin/cagent mcp server --port 8080 --agents-dir ./agents

# Available MCP tools:
# - invoke_agent: One-shot agent execution
# - list_agents: Discover available agents (files + registry images)  
# - pull_agent: Download agents from Docker registries
# - create_agent_session: Start persistent agent conversations
# - send_message: Continue conversations with session context
# - list_agent_sessions: View active sessions
# - get_agent_session_info: Session metadata and statistics
# - get_agent_session_history: Conversation history with pagination
# - close_agent_session: Clean session termination
```

### Integration Examples

**Claude Code Integration:**
```bash
# Claude Code can now programmatically:
# 1. Discover available cagent agents
# 2. Create persistent agent sessions
# 3. Have ongoing conversations with context
# 4. Review conversation history
# 5. Manage multiple concurrent agents
```

**VS Code Extensions:**
```bash
# MCP-compatible extensions can:
# - Embed cagent agents directly in editor workflows
# - Maintain conversation context across editing sessions
# - Access specialized agents for different tasks
```

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Service Core Architecture
**Decision**: Extract shared business logic into `pkg/servicecore/`
**Rationale**: Enables both MCP and HTTP transports to share identical business logic, security model, and session management

### 2. Client Isolation Strategy  
**Decision**: Real client IDs for MCP, `'__global'` for HTTP (until auth added)
**Rationale**: Immediate security for MCP clients while preserving HTTP backwards compatibility

### 3. Agent Resolution Security
**Decision**: Restrict all file access to configured root directory
**Rationale**: Prevents path traversal attacks while maintaining flexibility for legitimate agent configurations

### 4. Database Migration Strategy
**Decision**: Non-breaking migration with default values
**Rationale**: Zero downtime deployment with full backwards compatibility

## Next Steps: Phase 5 HTTP API Refactor

The **natural next step** is refactoring the existing HTTP API (`pkg/server/`) to use the same service core:

### Benefits of HTTP Refactor:
- **Shared security model**: Both transports get identical client isolation
- **Consistent behavior**: Identical session management across MCP and HTTP
- **Reduced maintenance**: Single business logic implementation
- **Enhanced security**: HTTP API gains proper client boundaries
- **Future authentication**: HTTP API prepared for client authentication

### Proposed HTTP Refactor Scope:
- **Extract HTTP handlers** to use `servicecore.ServiceManager`
- **Add HTTP client authentication** (JWT, API keys, etc.)
- **Maintain API compatibility** while enhancing security
- **Unified session storage** across both transports

## Testing & Quality

- **37+ test cases** covering all servicecore functionality
- **Isolated test environments** preventing production data contamination  
- **Comprehensive integration tests** for MCP server functionality
- **Security validation** for client isolation and path traversal prevention
- **Build verification** ensuring clean compilation and test passage

## Why This Matters

This MCP implementation **removes the integration barrier** that prevents cagent adoption in existing development workflows:

- **Warp users** can invoke cagent agents directly from their terminal without switching tools
- **Claude Code users** can seamlessly incorporate cagent agents into their coding workflows
- **Cursor/VS Code developers** can access cagent agents through MCP extensions
- **Existing tool users** don't have to abandon familiar environments to benefit from cagent

Instead of forcing users to choose between their current tools and cagent, **this enables both**. You can gradually migrate specific tasks to cagent agents while maintaining your existing development environment and workflow.

The service core foundation also **prepares cagent for enhanced security** across all interfaces once the HTTP refactor is complete.

## Demo

The implementation is **fully functional** and ready for testing:

```bash
# Build and start MCP server
task build
./bin/cagent mcp server --agents-dir examples/config --debug

# Test with the included MCP client
cd examples/mcptesting  
go run test-mcp-client.go
```
