# Step-by-Step Tutorial: Build Your First Agent

Welcome to the complete cagent tutorial! This hands-on guide will take you from zero to a working multi-agent system. You'll build increasingly sophisticated agents and learn best practices along the way.

## üéØ What You'll Build

By the end of this tutorial, you'll have created:

1. **Basic Assistant** - Simple conversational agent
2. **Research Agent** - Agent with web search capabilities
3. **Multi-Agent Team** - Coordinated specialists working together
4. **Advanced System** - Full-featured agent with thinking capabilities

## üìã Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- **cagent installed** and working on your system
- **API keys** for OpenAI and/or Anthropic
- **Basic YAML knowledge** (we'll explain as we go)
- **Text editor** (VS Code, Sublime, etc.)
- **Terminal/command line** access

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### 1. Verify Installation

```bash
# Check that cagent is installed
./cagent --help

# You should see the help output
```

### 2. Set API Keys

```bash
# For OpenAI
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-api-key-here

# For Anthropic (optional)
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Create Tutorial Directory

```bash
mkdir cagent-tutorial
cd cagent-tutorial
```

## üöÄ Chapter 1: Your First Agent

Let's start with the simplest possible agent to understand the basics.

### Step 1: Create a Basic Agent

Create a file called `basic-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    name: my_first_agent
    model: gpt4
    description: A friendly AI assistant
    instruction: |
      You are a friendly and helpful AI assistant. Always:
      - Be polite and professional
      - Provide clear, concise answers
      - Ask clarifying questions when needed

models:
  gpt4:
    type: openai
    model: gpt-4o
    temperature: 0.7
    max_tokens: 2000
```

### Step 2: Test Your First Agent

```bash
# Run your agent
./cagent -config basic-agent.yaml

# Try asking questions like:
# "Hello, what can you help me with?"
# "What's the weather like today?"
# "Explain quantum computing in simple terms"
```

### Step 3: Understanding the Configuration

Let's break down what each part does:

```yaml
agents:
  root: # Required: main agent entry point
    name: my_first_agent # Agent identifier (3-50 characters)
    model: gpt4 # References the model below
    description: "..." # Brief description (max 200 chars)
    instruction: | # Multi-line instructions (most important!)
      You are a friendly...

models:
  gpt4: # Model identifier (referenced above)
    type: openai # Provider: "openai" or "anthropic"
    model: gpt-4o # Specific model variant
    temperature: 0.7 # Creativity level (0.0-1.0)
    max_tokens: 2000 # Maximum response length
```

**üéâ Congratulations!** You've created your first agent. Try different questions and see how it responds.

## üîß Chapter 2: Adding Tools

Now let's give your agent superpowers by adding toolsets. Toolsets let agents interact with the outside world.

### Step 1: Create a Research Agent

Create `research-agent.yaml`:

```yaml
agents:
  root:
    name: research_assistant
    model: claude_research
    description: AI research assistant with web search
    instruction: |
      You are a professional research assistant with access to web search.

      **Your Process:**
      1. Listen carefully to research requests
      2. Use web search to find current, accurate information
      3. Analyze multiple sources for reliability
      4. Provide well-sourced, comprehensive answers
      5. Always cite your sources

      **Source Quality Guidelines:**
      - Prefer authoritative sources (.edu, .gov, established news)
      - Look for recent information when relevance matters
      - Cross-check facts across multiple sources

      **Available Tools:**
      - search(query): Search the web for current information
      - summarize(text): Summarize long text passages
    toolsets:
      - type: mcp
        command: npx
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-brave-search"]
        tools: ["search", "summarize"] # Only enable these specific tools

models:
  claude_research:
    type: anthropic
    model: claude-3-5-sonnet-latest
    temperature: 0.4
    max_tokens: 3000
```

### Step 2: Test Your Research Agent

```bash
# Run the research agent
./cagent -config research-agent.yaml

# Try research questions:
# "What are the latest developments in AI in 2024?"
# "Find information about sustainable energy trends"
# "Research the current stock market performance"
```

### Step 3: Understanding Toolsets

Toolsets extend what agents can do:

- **Web Search**: Gets current information from the internet
- **File Operations**: Reads and writes files
- **Database Access**: Queries databases
- **Custom Toolsets**: Your own specialized tools

Each toolset can expose multiple tools, and you can optionally filter which tools are available to the agent using the `tools` field.

Notice how we:

1. **Documented the available tools** in the instruction
2. **Explained when to use them** (for current information)
3. **Set quality standards** for source evaluation
4. **Filtered specific tools** we want to enable

**üí° Pro Tip**: Always tell your agent about its available tools in the instructions!

## üë• Chapter 3: Building a Multi-Agent Team

The real power of cagent comes from agents working together. Let's build a team!
