## Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. Kubernetes Cluster Instability *(Priority: High)*

**Suspected Cause:** Memory leaks in recently deployed service  
**Immediate Action Required:** Comprehensive log analysis and system diagnostics  
**Owner:** Mike (volunteered)  
**Timeline:** ASAP - before issue escalates

### 2. AWS Budget Overrun *(Priority: High)*
**Issue:** Monthly AWS costs exceed budget by $4,000  
**Suspected Causes:** 
- Inactive test environments consuming resources
- Lack of automated resource cleanup protocols  
**Proposed Solutions:** 24-hour automated environment termination (pending QA team workflow impact assessment)  
**Next Steps:** Schedule meeting with Finance department
